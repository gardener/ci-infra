# ci-infra

This repository contains configuration files for the testing and automation needs of the Gardener project.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning üöß

This is currently under construction / in evaluation phase.

## CI Job Management

Gardener uses a [`prow`](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/master/prow) instance at [prow.gardener.cloud](https://prow.gardener.cloud) to handle CI and automation for parts of the project.
Everyone can participate in a self-service PR-based workflow, where changes are automatically deployed after they have been reviewed and merged.
All job configs are located in [`config/jobs`](config/jobs).

### TestGrid
The results of prow jobs can be visualized in TestGrid in dashboards at [testgrid.k8s.io/gardener](https://testgrid.k8s.io/gardener). We don't run our own TestGrid installation, but include our dashboards into the TestGrid installation of Kubernetes.

We configured dashboards for each of our repositories where we run tests with prow. You find them at [config/testgrids/config.yaml](./config/testgrids/config.yaml).

When the desired dashboard is defined, you can add your prow job to a dashboard annotating them like in the example below.

```yaml
annotations:
  testgrid-dashboards: dashboard-name      # [Required] A dashboard already defined in gardener-testgrid.yaml.
  testgrid-tab-name: some-short-name       # [Optional] A shorter name for the tab. If omitted, just uses the job name.
  testgrid-alert-email: me@me.com          # [Optional] An alert email that will be applied to the tab created in the first dashboard specified in testgrid-dashboards.
  description: Words about your job.       # [Optional] A description of your job. If omitted, only the job name is used.
  testgrid-num-columns-recent: "10"        # [Optional] The number of runs in a row that can be omitted before the run is considered stale. The default value is 10.
  testgrid-num-failures-to-alert: "3"      # [Optional] The number of continuous failures before sending an email. The default value is 3.
  testgrid-days-of-results: "15"           # [Optional] The number of days for which the results are visible. The default value is 15.
  testgrid-alert-stale-results-hours: "12" # [Optional] The number of hours that pass with no results after which the email is sent. The default value is 12.
```

For `postsubmit` and `periodic` prow jobs there will be a test-group created automatically. If you don't want to add them to TestGrid please use this annotation to disable creation of a test-group. For `presubmit` prow jobs no test-group will be created unless you annotate them as in the previous example.
```yaml
annotations:
  testgrid-create-test-group: "false"
```

You can test your TestGrid configuration locally with the `./hack/check-testgrid-config.sh`. Please open a PR for `ci-infra` repository for your new configuration. When it is merged the new configuration will be pushed to `gs://gardener-prow/testgrid/config` automatically and your jobs will become visible at [testgrid.k8s.io/gardener](https://testgrid.k8s.io/gardener) soon.


## How to setup

1. Create the prow cluster and prow workload cluster.
   ```bash
   $ kubectl apply -f config/clusters/shoot.yaml
   $ kubectl apply -f config/clusters/shoot-workload.yaml
   ```
1. Create the `prow` namespace in the prow cluster:
   ```bash
   $ kubectl apply -f config/prow/cluster/prow_namespace.yaml
   ```
1. Create the `test-pods` namespace in the workload/build cluster:
   ```bash
   $ kubectl apply -f config/prow/cluster/build
   ```   
1. Create the required secrets (mainly in the prow cluster):
    - `gardener-prow-storage` (Service account with `Storage Admin` permissions for GCS bucket, according to [test-infra guide](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/f8021394c8e493af2d3ec336a87888368d92e0c8/prow/getting_started_deploy.md#configure-a-gcs-bucket), needs to be present in the `prow` namespace and in the `test-pods` namespace in both clusters)
    - `github-app` (according to [test-infra guide](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/f8021394c8e493af2d3ec336a87888368d92e0c8/prow/getting_started_deploy.md#github-app))
    - `github-token` (Personal Access Token for [@gardener-ci-robot](https://github.com/gardener-ci-robot) with scopes `public_repo, read:org, repo:status`, needs to be present in the `prow` and `test-pods` namespace of the prow cluster)
    - `github-oauth-config` (according to [test-infra guide](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/f8021394c8e493af2d3ec336a87888368d92e0c8/prow/cmd/deck/github_oauth_setup.md))
    - `hmac-token`
      ```bash
      $ kubectl -n prow create secret generic hmac-token --from-literal=hmac=$(openssl rand -hex 20)
      ```
    - `oauth-cookie-secret`
      ```bash
      $ kubectl -n prow create secret generic oauth-cookie-secret --from-literal=secret=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
      ```
    - `kubeconfig` (ref [test-infra guide](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/f8021394c8e493af2d3ec336a87888368d92e0c8/prow/getting_started_deploy.md#run-test-pods-in-different-clusters), needs to be present in the `prow` and `test-pods` namespace of the prow cluster)
      - add two contexts: the prow cluster as `gardener-prow-trusted` and the build/workload cluster as `gardener-prow-build`
      - `gardener-prow-trusted` context should use the in-cluster `ServiceAccount` token and CA file, so that all Prow components are bound to their respective RBAC roles
      - `gardener-prow-build` needs to be bound to the `cluster-admin` role. The [gencred](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/tree/master/gencred) utility can be used to easily create a `ServiceAccount` and `ClusterRoleBinding` and retrieve the `ServiceAccount` token.
      - Template:
        ```yaml
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Config
        current-context: gardener-prow-build # default cluster
        contexts:
        - name: gardener-prow-trusted
          context:
            cluster: gardener-prow-trusted
            user: gardener-prow-trusted-token
        - name: gardener-prow-build
          context:
            cluster: gardener-prow-build
            user: gardener-prow-build-token
        clusters:
        - name: gardener-prow-trusted
          cluster: # in-cluster config
            server: 'https://kubernetes.default.svc'
            certificate-authority: /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt
        - name: gardener-prow-build
          cluster:
            server: <<workload-cluster-api-server-address>>
            certificate-authority-data: <<base64-encoded-CA-bundle>>
        users:
        - name: gardener-prow-trusted-token
          user:
            tokenFile: /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token # use in-cluster config
        - name: gardener-prow-build-token
          user:
            token: <<service-account-token-with-cluster-admin-permissions>> # generated via gencred
        ```
    - `slack-token` (according to [test-infra guide](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/master/prow/cmd/crier/README.md#slack-reporter))
    - `alertmanager-prow-slack` (needs to be present in the `monitoring` namespace of the prow trusted and build cluster)
      - Follow https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks and setup a webhook.
      - Create the secret including the Webhook URL under key `api_url`.
    - `grafana` (admin user password)
      ```bash
      $ kubectl config use-context gardener-prow-trusted
      $ kubectl -n monitoring create secret generic grafana-admin --from-literal=admin_password=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
      $ kubectl config use-context gardener-prow-build
      $ kubectl -n monitoring create secret generic grafana-admin --from-literal=admin_password=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
      ```
1. Deploy Prow components. The initial deployment has to be done manually, later on changes to the components will be automatically deployed once merged into master.
   ```bash
   $ ./config/prow/deploy.sh
   ```
1. Bootstrap Prow configuration/jobs. This initial configuration has to be done manually, later on changes to configuration and jobs will be automatically applied by the [`updateconfig`](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/tree/master/prow/plugins/updateconfig) plugin once merged into master.
   ```bash
   $ ./hack/boostrap-config.sh
   ```

## Monitoring

A monitoring stack based on [kube-prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus) plus [test-infra monitoring](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/tree/master/config/prow/cluster/monitoring) capabilities is installed in the prow clusters:
- [prometheus-operator](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator)
- alertmanager (cluster with 3 replicas for HA)
- prometheus (2 replicas for HA)
- blackbox-exporter
- kube-state-metrics
- grafana

Alertmanager will send Slack alerts in `#gardener-prow-alerts` (SAP-internal workspace).

Grafana is available publicly at https://monitoring.prow.gardener.cloud (trusted cluster) and https://monitoring-build.prow.gardener.cloud (build cluster).
