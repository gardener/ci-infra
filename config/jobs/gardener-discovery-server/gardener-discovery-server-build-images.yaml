        # image-builder is the pod which is "scheduled" to a node. The pods created by image-builder have an affinity rule
        # which schedules them to the same node as their parent image-builder. This needs to be done, that PVCs could be mounted
        # to multiple build pods in parallel.
        # For a proper scheduling the combined resource requests of all build pods are assigned to this pod, even though it does not
        # use them. The resource requests of build pods themselves are "0"
