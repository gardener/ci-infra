Tide respects the `skip-review` label on all PRs opened by the robot user and merges PRs without review as soon as tests succeed.",
  // Note that we could also use `addLabels=["skip-review"]` instead of `automerge=true`. However, this config
  // helps with reusing automerge-based renovate presets and is more intuitive to configure in package rules.
